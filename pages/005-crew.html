<h1><del>werc</del> <span style="">crew</span> - A sane web anti-framework<span style="">, that suckless</span></h1>

<p><del>Werc</del> <span style="">Crew</span> is a minimalist web anti-framework built following the <a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/unix/">Unix</a> and <a href="http://plan9.cat-v.org">Plan 9</a> <em>tool philosophy</em> of software design. <span style="">Crew is a <a href="http://suckless.org">suckless</a> clone of werc, well, not a 100% clone&hellip;But I really like the idea of werc and its weird sense of humor.</span></p>

<p><del>Werc</del><span style="">Crew</span> avoids the pain of managing collections of websites and developing web applications.</p>

<ul>
<li>Database free, uses files and directories instead.</li>
<li><del>Written using <a href="http://rc.cat-v.org">the rc shell</a>, leveraging the standard Unix/Plan 9 command toolkit.</del> <span style="">Written in Go, single file, which suckless, yo!</span></li>
<li>Minimize tedious work: eg., no need to ever write HTML, use markdown (or any other format) instead.</li>
<li>Very minimalist yet extensible codebase: <del>highly functional core is 150 lines, with extra functionality in modular <a href="/apps/">apps</a>.</del> <span style=""> Checkout <a href="https://github.com/c4pt0r/crew/blob/master/main.go">main.go</a></span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Here are some of the features provided by <del>werc</del><span style="">crew</span>:</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="">When you want to turn a directory into a website in a hurry :)</span></li>
<li>Good integration with pre-existing content, you can add HTML or plain text files and they will be seamlessly integrated with the rest of the site.</li>
<li>You can use your favorite tools (text editor, shell, file manager, etc) to edit, manipulate and manage data stored in <del>werc</del><span style="">crew</span>.</li>
<li><del>Designed to manage any number of ‘virtual’ domains that share a common style and layout from a single werc installation.</del><span style="">No, too complicated, single directory is easier</span></li>
<li><del>Configuration and customization can be at at any level: global, per-domain-group, domain-wide, directory sub-tree, and single file.</del><span style="">Configuration should be with the file and code, if you want to change the layout, just change the code and recompile</span></li>
<li>Can trivially run multiple (customized) versions of <del>werc</del><span style="">crew</span> side by side. <span style="">Yeah, just launch another process</span></li>
<li>Very simple and flexible user management and permissions system.<span style="">You should take good care of your own file system</span></li>
<li><del>Applications can be easily combined: eg., add comments to your blog or wiki by enabling the ‘bridge’ app; or by enabling the ‘diridir’ wiki convert any document tree into a wiki.</del><span style="">No, keep it simple</span></li>
<li><del>Can easily write werc ‘apps’ and extensions in <em>any</em> language! (But of course, rc is recommended).</del><span style="">No, if you want to modify crew, you should understand what you&rsquo;re going to do, and recompile main.go</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Install Requirements</h2>

<p><del>All you need is some Plan 9 commands (cat, grep, sed, rc, etc.), and an HTTP server with CGI support.</del></p>

<p><del>Werc runs on any Unix-like system where <a href="https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/">Plan 9 from User Space</a>, <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/9base/">9base</a>, or <a href="https://code.9front.org/hg/frontbase">frontport</a> are available (this includes Linux, *BSD, OS X and Solaris), and on Plan 9.</del></p>

<p><del>Werc can use any HTTP server that can handle CGI, and has been tested with at least Apache, Lighttpd, Cherokee, nhttpd, Hiawatha, rc-httpd, cgd, and others.</del></p>

<p><span style="">Basiclly any systems, but I&rsquo;ve never tested crew on Plan9, I will, no, I won&rsquo;t</span></p>

<p><del>Werc</del><span style="">Crew</span> uses markdown by default (and the standard <del>Perl</del> markdown <span style="">(gomarkdown/markdown)</span> is included with the distribution), to format documents, but any other formatting system can be used.</p>
